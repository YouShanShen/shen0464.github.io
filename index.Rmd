As an oncology pharmacist for six years, I enjoyed providing evidence-based research to solve problems and had multiple interprofessional collaborative practice experiences. My work in this area has involved applications of targeted breast cancer biomarkers analysis and evaluating the risk of thrombosis of drugs in males.
